Alexa Emergency Skill (Hackathon Concept)
This project was created as part of a university hackathon and is a conceptual demonstration of an Alexa First Responder Skill. It showcases how voice-activated emergency response could work in the future, using simulated data and mock functionality for demonstration purposes only.

🔧 Key Features (Prototype Only):
Emergency Detection (Simulated):

Recognizes simulated voice commands to identify emergency types (fire, medical, police).

Mimics use of location data to determine where help is “needed.”

Smart Response System (Conceptual):

Pretends to dispatch first responders based on the simulated emergency type:

🔥 Fire department for fire

🚑 Medical services for health

🚓 Police for security

No real services are contacted; this is a mockup.

Safety Confirmation Logic:

Demonstrates how Alexa might ask for confirmation during unclear situations.

Showcases logic to "err on the side of caution" in the event of no response.

Interactive Demo:

Buttons simulate different emergency scenarios.

Visuals change based on simulated responses:

🔴 Red for fire

🟢 Green for medical

🔵 Blue for police

Location and emergency status are displayed using placeholder data.

Important Note:
This project was developed for fun as part of a hackathon. It is not connected to real emergency services, does not use live location or voice data, and is not intended for actual use in emergency situations.

This kind of hands-on concept helped us explore how voice technology might enhance emergency response systems and gave us an opportunity to experiment with Alexa Skills development in a creative setting.
